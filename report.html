<h2>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement.</h2>

<p>I have created a website called “Food World” which has the structure of a magazine. This online magazine’s main purpose is to inform readers about cooking, by providing a range of recipes, cooking tips, and related articles such as a basic guide of herbs and spices.</p>
<p>Secondarily, as my website isn’t just an online recipe book, but rather a magazine, I had to include some type on entertainment for the audience, which I implemented by including quizzes, and celebrity chef interviews.</p>

<h2>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc. </h2>

<p>The main inspiration to create “Food Wold” was my own passion. From a young age I have been fond of cooking, especially since back home in Spain my dad had a restaurant, where I got to spent lots of time watching my dad cooking a variety of dishes. So, when I had to create a magazine website, I knew instantly to relate it to cooking, as I had so much content in mind which would be great to be shared with people who enjoy and are interested to cook. </p>

<p>A celebrity chef who inspired me was Jamie Oliver, I usually tend to watch him with on tv, and sometimes if I really like a recipe, I like to look for it on his website, https://www.jamieoliver.com ,so I can cook it myself. His website has inspired me to create a similar navigation system, which has many sub-categories under “recipes”, providing readers the option to find more specific content. Over the time I have learnt some of his cooking tips, some of which included on my website, also I found a previous interview of his which I found interesting, so I decided to put it on my website too.</p>

<p>Whilst I has searching on the web other cooking websites so I could visit and find inspiration to start designing mine, I came across “food network”, http://www.foodnetwork.co.uk , this website really inspired me to conclude my wireframes and mock-ups for “Food World”. I really liked the idea of displaying recipes in a “card” format, as it looks neat, and only if the readers are interested, they can choose to read more. </p>

<p>I was also very impressed with the quiz section “Food Network” had, so being inspired from that, I decided to develop 2 quizzes on my website, which had questions and answers related to generally cooking and food.
State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</p>

<p>https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/make-your-website-accessible/ </p>

<p>Whilst I was developing my website, I had to consider to include certain things in terms of the design and the code, which would make the website more accessible for users.</p>

<p>One thing I did, was to include “alt” or alternative text to all images, so in case pictures are unable to load, readers can still have a brief description of what the image represents. But most importantly, the alt attribute will help visually impaired users to be able to hear the description of the image through screen readers.</p>

<p>Also, while I was designing the mock-ups of the website, I had the chance to play around with background and content colours so I could carefully select the best colour combination, in a way that the reader can see a clear contrast from the background and the text, ensuring that the content stands out, and doesn’t make readers eyes to struggle to view the page.</p>

<p>After researching colour combinations which are best to be avoided, as it could mislead colours blind users, such as green and red, blue and purple, I had decided to use a standard white background for the content with black text. </p>

<p>Another technique I used to make the website accessible is by making appropriate used of HTML semantic tags.  I did so to ensure that the element is meaningful to the browser, so it can be displayed in its correct default position and the viewer’s find it usual too. For example, some of the sematic tags, I used, is a header tag, a nav tag which contains the navigation bar, an article tag, which had been used to display celebrity interviews, and a footer tag.</p>

<h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h2>

<p>I have considered usability of my website by including a responsive navigation bar, which is known as toggle navigation. This make the navbar bar to display horizontally displays all the different links to other pages on desktops, but as it gets resized to tablet’s and smartphone’s screen size, a row of three icon-bars appear, which as is clicked it displays the navigation options vertically, so it fits the screen better. </p>

<p>In my opinion, a toggle navigation is a great way to implement usability, as nowadays most web users, surf on websites through their smartphones or tablet devices rather than desktops.</p>

<p>As a website user, I enjoy effortlessly visiting website, so on my website, I have included a button called “up” to be displayed once the viewer has scrolled down by 100 pixels, as this button is clicked, the page scrolls back to the top. This feature is very suitable as some pages are long, and this will make visitors to use the website more comfortable, without the need to keep scrolling back to the top.</p>

<p>Also, I have tried to use only necessary media content, such as images, as I know that too many images make the website slow to load, which is something viewers dislike. But I still do have a good number of images, which all together make the website’s file size really big to load, therefore I have optimised the images, so I can reduce their individual file size, this way the website won’t take long to fully display it’s content. I have optimised the images on, https://imagecompressor.com/ .</p>

<h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site). </h2>

<p>1.	One of the first things that I had to learn and explore was Bootstrap. As I knew from the beginning that I had to create a responsive website, I wanted to make the most of the available tools I had, apart from CSS elements such as media queries which also can aid responsiveness, so I decided to learn how to use bootstrap framework.</p>

<p>At first, I had to download the bootstrap files and link them to my html pages, after which I started watching online tutorials to learn how to make use of the pre-made properties bootstrap offers, such as the container class which provides a responsive width container to elements inside it. I used the “img-responsive” class for the images which make images to have a maximum width of 100%, this way they scale with their specific parent element. </p>

<p>I learnt to use the grid system which allows displaying content in a more structured layout a way according to our preferences. I have used bootstrap’s JavaScript plugin to implement modals to displays more information about recipes, also I used the jumbotron component to showcase the main topic in an article called “Guide to spices”. </p>

<p>These were only some of the examples, I learnt in bootstrap, actually my code has lots of useful classes and components which are part of this framework.</p>

<p>2.	I also learned more advanced CSS properties that I wasn’t familiar with.  For example, I wanted to make the subscribe button animation to keep looping, so it gives a flashing effect, for which I wrote the “animation-iteration-count” property that I set to infinite, so it keeps iterating.</p>

<p>I learnt about the usage of flexboxes, such as  the property “display: flex”, and “flex-wrap: wrap” which indicates to wrap the items, and becomes a flexible container. I also learnt about the usage of the “transition: transform” property which I used in various places to give the effect of movement, for example, on the cooking tips page, where the cards are flipping as the user overs over them.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I learn to use CSS media queries to make the website be responsive and display sensibly, for example , for the desktop and tablet I have left the h1 tag to be default, but in the mobile version, it looks too big, so I have resized it in a smaller font-size.</p>

<p>3.	I learnt to write simple JavaScript from scratch, for example, I had created a simple search bar only for the homepage which I wanted to be functional for the users, so I created a function which had an “if ” statement inside it to specify, if any of the particular works are entered, a specific page should be opened. </p>


<h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2>

<p>1.	In my opinion, once I understood the basics of bootstrap, implementing responsiveness was not too difficult, as it offered already default toggle navigation with icon-bars, so overall, I feel the navigation bar is fit for purpose. The same way, by using bootstrap framework, it the contented didn’t collapse on top of each other, rather if I was unhappy the way a particular section resized, I corrected it with a media query, such as the image grid on interviews page. So, I think the content resizes well on various devices.</p>

<p>2.	I really like the way astatically the website looks. In my opinion the combination of colours diffuses very well with each other, such as the logo, top navbar, footer and the headings they match with each other. Also, the background image, automatically makes visitors perceive the theme of the website, which is mainly cooking and food in general. I think that I was able to come up with a good colour palette because, before starting the design I took ideas from various other cooking related websites and took inspiration from there, about the aspects I liked, but also about the things I didn’t like, so I can avoid it on my design.   </p>

<p>3.	Also, I am quite satisfied in the amount of interactivity my website has. As the website is an online magazine, I wanted to make sure the audience feels engaged, hence I included two quizzes, also in the cooking tips page, readers will have to hover over images to read the tip information, and below they are free to leave their feedback on how they found the tips. These was some elements I included to ensure readers are engaged with the website and enjoy surfing on it.</p>

<h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h2>

<p>Under recipes, there’s four recipe pages (breakfast, cook to impress, deserts and everyday meals). All of these pages have a consistent structure and design, which is a card model, that when the reader clicks on “Read more”, a modal pop-up, with the ingredients and the preparation method of the recipe.</p>

<p>Even though the pages inform users of recipes, I would have really liked to add extra functionality, by including a print button in the modal, so readers are able to print individual recipes.  Also, I would have liked to make a logging system, so users would have been able to save their favourite recipes, though a button called “Save” placed next to the “Read more” button on the recipe card.</p>

<p>Lastly, I would have really liked to make a more complex comments section on cooking tips page, which would require as a must to write the commenter’s name and would have an option to insert a profile picture, additionally, once a comment has been posted, I would have liked to display the day it was posted on the right side.</p>

<p>What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts. </p>

<h2>Sources of information used on my website:</h2>
    
<p>The 16 recipes that are posted on my recipes pages are from “BBC good food”, https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes,  and “Food Network”, http://www.foodnetwork.co.uk .</p>

<p>Libraries and other plugins used on my website:</p>
<p>I have included bootstrap on my website, so I had to download the files, form which I kept the CSS, jQuery plugin and the JS file. I have found these on, https://getbootstrap.com/ .</p>

<p>href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"</p>
<p>src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"</p>
<p>src="js/bootstrap.min.js"</p>

<p>Below is the link of "font awesome icons" which I had used to display the social media links, by writing the prefix of "fa":</p>

<p>https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css.</p>

<p>I wanted to personalise my website by using an external font-family form Google Fonts, to do so, I used the link tag and pasted its reference on it. I have shown it below:</p>

<p>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sarabun .</p>

<p>Code that I have used on my website:</p>
<p>I wanted my website to display the date written on the top navbar, as some magazine websites, do display the date. I have found the code on : https://codepen.io/samrawks/pen/OBwGdK . I later edit its style.</p>

<p>I have used code to display a carousel from, https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_ref_js_carousel_js&stacked=h. I had changed its width, the images and their captions, as well as the indicators.</p>

<p>On my recipes page, I have used a bootstrap modal to display the recipe. I found the template on, https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/ , I have fully edited it by styling it, changing the individual modal IDs, writing a recipe inside it and making it part of a card.</p>

<p>To write the interview articles on the interviews page I got inspired form this page: https://codepen.io/garystorey/pen/RodKaW , so I used few of the CSS properties.</p>

<p>I inserted a button which takes the page back to the top, as it is clicked, I found this code from, https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_scroll_to_top. I made adaptations to it by changing the pixel number and varying the style of it.</p>

<p>In my website I have 2 quizzes called, foodQuiz.html and recipeQuiz.html, I have adapted the code I found on, https://codepen.io/gerleone73/pen/jEzdGz . I have changed the code by writing my own questions and answers, also by inserting my own images. I applied different styling too.</p>

<p>On cooking tips page, I have a set of 6 images which can be “flipped” when the cursor hovers over it, I have been inspired from, https://codepen.io/madebyzara/pen/ENQMbB .</p>

<p>Also, on the cooking tips page, I have included a simple comments sections that I found on, https://codepen.io/humbl3man/pen/zqLbzN , it has been adapted it by deleting  the button called “remove-all”, as I didn’t want the readers to have the freedom to delete other people’s comments.</p>
