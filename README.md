# What is FoodWorld?

I have created a website called “Food World” which has the structure of a magazine. 
This online magazine’s main purpose is to inform readers about cooking, by providing a range of recipes, cooking tips, and related articles such as a basic guide of herbs and spices.

As my website isn’t just an online recipe book, but rather a magazine, I had to include some type on entertainment for the audience, which I implemented by including quizzes, and celebrity chef interviews

# Progamming languages/libraries used to build FoodWorld?

In short: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

- One of the first things that I had to learn and explore was Bootstrap. As I knew from the beginning that I had to create a responsive website, I wanted to make the most of the available tools I had, apart from CSS elements such as media queries which also can aid responsiveness, so I decided to learn how to use bootstrap framework.
At first, I had to download the bootstrap files and link them to my html pages, after which I started watching online tutorials to learn how to make use of the pre-made properties bootstrap offers, such as the container class which provides a responsive width container to elements inside it. I used the “img-responsive” class for the images which make images to have a maximum width of 100%, this way they scale with their specific parent element. 
I learnt to use the grid system which allows displaying content in a more structured layout a way according to our preferences.
I have used bootstrap’s JavaScript plugin to implement modals to displays more information about recipes, also I used the jumbotron component to showcase the main topic in an article called “Guide to spices”. 
These were only some of the examples, I learnt in bootstrap, actually my code has lots of useful classes and components which are part of this framework.

- I also learned more advanced CSS properties that I wasn’t familiar with.  For example, I wanted to make the subscribe button animation to keep looping, so it gives a flashing effect, for which I wrote the “animation-iteration-count” property that I set to infinite, so it keeps iterating.
I learnt about the usage of flexboxes, such as  the property “display: flex”, and “flex-wrap: wrap” which indicates to wrap the items, and becomes a flexible container. I also learnt about the usage of the “transition: transform” property which I used in various places to give the effect of movement, for example, on the cooking tips page, where the cards are flipping as the user overs over them.
Most importantly, I learn to use CSS media queries to make the website be responsive and display sensibly, for example, for the desktop and tablet I have left the h1 tag to be default, but in the mobile version, it looks too big, so I have resized it in a smaller font-size.

- I learnt to write simple JavaScript from scratch, for example, I had created a search bar which I wanted to be functional for the users, so I created a function which had an “if ” statement inside it to specify, if any of the particular works are entered, a specific page should be opened, and “else” it should display a message saying that the search couldn’t be found.

# Why was FoodWorld created?
I created FoodWorld as part of my Web Development module coursework, which was due during my 1st Year of my CS degree at Goldsmiths University of London.
